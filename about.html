					A few interesting facts about me. I love listening to music (my

					person shooters such as Rainbow6:Siege where I have lead an eSports
					organisation before. I love learning new things by picking up new

					I pride myself in self-improvement, as a person that loves the spirit
					of competition, I thrive in a competitve environment as it pushes me
					to continuously improve upon myself so as to remain competitive with
					my peers. I also look out for things in life that I would like to
					improve on, whether if its learning how to build good relationships
					with people or figuring out how to dress better. I don't mind stepping
					out of my comfort zone if it meant that I could do more things.
